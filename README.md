My copy of repo for BGSE [text mining](https://github.com/rishi1226/text_mining) course.

Below is original README:

------------------------
### Class Resources
1. Python 2.7
2. ipython notebook

For windows user, you may find it more useful to download anaconda.

    `python scrape\_contracts.py 0 20 10_` 

Read the script to know more about what these parameters mean.

Edit:- changes made to script
